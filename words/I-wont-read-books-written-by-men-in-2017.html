			<p>Every year, I set myself a reading challenge. This started in 2013, when I challenged myself to read 100 books. I narrowly missed at 96, which I still count as a win because 96 books!</p>

			<p>Since then, I have read 56 books a year.
      <br>So far, that’s 252 books.</p>
			<p>A few months ago, I was ranting about the lack of diversity in the content we consume; whether it is directors, writers and producers in film and television, authors of the books we read, speakers and panels at conferences, news anchors and journalists, ad infinitum.</p>

      <p>It made me consider the medium I consume the most, books. So I tallied it up. Since I began my reading challenge, the authors I’ve read each year have been:</p>

			<ul>
        <li>2013: 22 women / 74 men</li>
  			<li>2014: 25 women / 27 men</li>
  			<li>2015: 16 women / 36 men</li>
  			<li>2016: 18 women / 34 men</li>
  			<li>Total: 81 women / 171 men</li>
      </ul>
        
			<p>I’m embarrassed by this. My reading list is dominated by male authors. More than twice as many.</p>
			<p>I’ve worked through several “Top 100 books everyone should read” lists, which are often very male-heavy. I read books recommended from friends and colleagues. I read books recommended by authors I like. I pick up random books at the library.</p>
			<p>You’d think my selection would be more diverse.</p>
			<p>I have decided to add to my challenge for 2017 and only read books written by female or non-cisgender authors. Should I have to read a male author, it wouldn’t count towards my challenge.</p>
			<p>I’m looking forward to broadening the voices that I’m listening to. You can <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13607025-sonia">view my book lists here.</a></p>
