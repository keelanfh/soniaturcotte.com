		<div class="item-content">
			<p>I recently had the opportunity to hear Kathryn Sophie Belle at an event organised by Goldsmith’s Centre for Feminist Research. It was called “<a href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/calendar/?id=11781">A Debate Between Claudia Jones and Simone de Beauvoir</a>”.</p> 

      <p>I missed the main talk but attended the Q&amp;A. Everything she said was golden. Here are a few of my notes. 
      </p>

      <div class="blockquote">
        <h2>On white feminism</h2>
        <p class="first-child">If you are comparing yourself to an oppressed group without trying to also liberate them, it’s still an exploitative relationship.</p>
        <p>White feminism is trying to get from the object to the subject by exploiting the abject.</p>

        <h2>On popularity</h2>
        <p class="first-child">Terms, such as intersectionality and identity politics, can be appropriated and depoliticized. Be attentive to the context in which these ideas were generated.</p>

        <h2>On philosophy </h2>
        <p class="first-child">Philosophy often speaks in the universal when it means the particular. Philosophy is not going to save us.</p> 
        <p>Who counts as a philosopher and who doesn’t is problematic. Claudia Jones spoke and wrote about Marxism, but she is not in the Marxist canon.</p>
        <p>Instead of ignoring the canon or “throwing them out”, read them with a critical lens. Expand what is meant by philosophy and who is considered a philosophical thinker.</p>

        <p>And question: who are you citing?</p>
