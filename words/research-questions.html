      <p>I have spent the last few weeks deciding what I want to do for my <a href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/ma-critical-creative-analysis">masters dissertation</a>. At this stage it’s pretty wooly, but I wanted to share the questions I’m thinking about to get more ideas.</p>

      <p>So, here is my working title</p>

      <div class="blockquote">
        <p>What contribution does the collection and use of data have on queer bodies, identities and behaviours?</p>
      </div>

      <p>And possible research questions</p>

      <div class="blockquote"> 
        <p>In what ways are our identities and experiences constituted by data (and missing data sets)? How does this affect those who are not represented?</p>
      
        <p>What can be learned from the absence of data sets in particular areas of queer lives? How does it correlate to what is considered normative?</p> 
        
        <p>What ways do people ‘perform’ queerness, both within and outside the norms, and how does that feed back into the generation and collection of new data sets?</p>
        
        <p>How does the collection and representation of queer people in data sets impact their corporeal and material experiences?</p>
        
        <p> What effect does the requirement for humans to be increasingly machine-readable have on individuals?</p>
      </div>

      <p>This is a completely new field for me, so I welcome any ideas or converstions.</p> 

      <p>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/sonia_turcotte">I’d love to hear</a> about interesting readings, examples and case studies, people or organisations doing work in this area, etc.
