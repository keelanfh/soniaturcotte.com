# Hello world

Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. I was part of something special. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!

Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! *Must go faster*.

Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. I was part of something special. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Life finds a way.
